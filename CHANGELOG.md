## 0.1.0

Initial public release.

`gsax` provides global sensitivity analysis in JAX with seven complementary
methods:

- **Sobol** indices via Saltelli sampling — first-, total-, and second-order,
  with JAX-accelerated bootstrap confidence intervals.
- **RS-HDMR** — B-spline surrogate with ANCOVA decomposition and a built-in
  emulator; works with any `(X, Y)` sample pairs.
- **PCE** — Polynomial Chaos Expansion with analytical Sobol indices and
  leave-one-out cross-validation.
- **eFAST** — Extended Fourier Amplitude Sensitivity Test.
- **DGSM** — Derivative-based measures via JAX autodiff, with Poincaré-constant
  bounds on total Sobol indices.
- **HSIC** — Hilbert–Schmidt Independence Criterion (kernel-based dependence,
  R2-HSIC and Total HSIC, permutation p-values).
- **PAWN** — moment-independent, CDF-based sensitivity via Kolmogorov–Smirnov
  distances.

All methods support scalar, multi-output, and time-series outputs and export to
labeled `xarray` Datasets.
