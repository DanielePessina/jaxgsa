# Changelog

## 0.1.1

### Fixed

- HDMR: widen the `scan`/`vmap` loop-variable annotations to `int | Array`
  so the package type-checks under newer `ty` releases (no runtime change).
- Loosen the HDMR chunk-size regression test tolerance to absorb
  floating-point reduction-order differences across jax versions.

### Changed

- Documentation installs gsax from PyPI (`pip install gsax` / `uv add gsax`).
- Update pinned development/CI dependencies and GitHub Actions; add weekly
  Dependabot updates for Python dependencies.

## 0.1.0

Initial public release.

`gsax` provides global sensitivity analysis in JAX with seven complementary
methods:

- **Sobol** indices via Saltelli sampling — first-, total-, and second-order,
  with JAX-accelerated bootstrap confidence intervals.
- **RS-HDMR** — B-spline surrogate with ANCOVA decomposition and a built-in
  emulator; works with any `(X, Y)` sample pairs.
- **PCE** — Polynomial Chaos Expansion with analytical Sobol indices and
  leave-one-out cross-validation.
- **eFAST** — Extended Fourier Amplitude Sensitivity Test.
- **DGSM** — Derivative-based measures via JAX autodiff, with Poincaré-constant
  bounds on total Sobol indices.
- **HSIC** — Hilbert–Schmidt Independence Criterion (kernel-based dependence,
  R2-HSIC and Total HSIC, permutation p-values).
- **PAWN** — moment-independent, CDF-based sensitivity via Kolmogorov–Smirnov
  distances.

All methods support scalar, multi-output, and time-series outputs and export to
labeled `xarray` Datasets.
